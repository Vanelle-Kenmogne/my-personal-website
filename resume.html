    <h1> My Curriculum Vitae </h1>
    <p>
            I am a dedicated research scientist with a deep passion for <strong>academic exploration</strong> and <strong>advancing knowledge</strong> in my field. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in precision medicine/drug discovery, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to the world of research and knowledge sharing. With a solid foundation in biochemistry and biological data analysis, I have developed a strong expertise in <em>drug discovery for personalized medicine</em>. 
    Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in research collaborations, academic conferences, and published scholarly works (more than 6 research articles published in international journals). These experiences have honed my critical thinking, analytical skills, and ability to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams (I have reviewed more than 12 publications for indo journal of pharmaceutical sciences). I am well-versed in various research methodologies and adept at collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data to draw meaningful conclusions.
    As a research assistant, I have had the privilege to work alongside esteemed faculty members and contribute to cutting-edge research projects, grant writing. I am experienced in conducting literature reviews, managing research databases.
